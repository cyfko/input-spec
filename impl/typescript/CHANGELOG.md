## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-06

### Breaking Changes
- Removed legacy `enumValues` on constraints in favor of unified `valuesEndpoint` with domain `mode` (`CLOSED` or `SUGGESTIONS`).
- Replaced composite constraint objects (min/max/pattern combined) with strictly atomic constraint descriptors (`minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `minValue`, `maxValue`, `minDate`, `maxDate`, `range`, `custom`).
- Moved field-level `format` (previously a failing constraint in some integrations) to a non-failing advisory `formatHint` property on `InputFieldSpec`.
- Constraint error indexing for multi-value fields is now per element with `index` included in each `ValidationError`.
- Membership evaluation semantics clarified: closed membership occurs before atomic constraints; per-element membership errors use `constraintName: 'membership'` and include index for multi-value.

### Added
- Unified `valuesEndpoint` abstraction supporting INLINE (embedded), HTTP/HTTPS, and gRPC protocols plus `CLOSED` vs `SUGGESTIONS` modes.
- Optional, library-only coercion layer (not part of wire protocol) with opt-in global and per-field control: numeric strings ‚Üí numbers, boolean strings / numeric booleans ‚Üí booleans, epoch timestamps ‚Üí ISO dates, configurable trimming, underscore numeric normalization, extensible true/false token sets, and custom number patterns.
- Comprehensive v1 ‚Üí v2 migration helper `migrateV1Spec` producing canonical atomic descriptors and INLINE domain definitions.
- Expanded validation pipeline stages (required ‚Üí type ‚Üí membership ‚Üí constraints) ensuring deterministic ordering and full error aggregation (no early exit after first failure).
- Extended test suite (now 93 tests) covering conformance, migration fidelity, edge cases (invalid pattern resilience, partial ranges, unresolved remote domains), coercion behavior, and multi-value indexing semantics.

### Changed
- Error message consistency: standardized phrasing for length, size, numeric, and date constraints (e.g., `Minimum X characters`, `Maximum X items`).
- Multi-value string fields interpret `minValue` / `maxValue` applied to STRING dataType as item count semantics for backward compatibility with legacy expectations.

### Deprecated
- Internal legacy adapter `applyLegacyConstraint` retained only for migration tests and marked with `@deprecated`; scheduled for removal in 3.0.0.

### Migration Guide (Summary)
1. Replace any legacy composite constraint object with a list of atomic descriptors.
2. Convert `enumValues` to an INLINE `valuesEndpoint` with `mode: 'CLOSED'`.
3. Move `format` to `formatHint` (advisory only).
4. Run `migrateV1Spec` for automated transformation where possible.
5. Review multi-value fields for per-element error expectations and update consumer logic if it relied on aggregated messaging.

### Notes
- Coercion is intentionally excluded from the protocol specification to preserve deterministic schema interpretation across services. All coercion options are purely library conveniences and default to disabled.
- Remote `valuesEndpoint` resolution (HTTP/gRPC) is intentionally deferred; unresolved closed domains skip membership until externally populated.

### Internal Quality Improvements
- Added underscore numeric normalization to support patterns allowing visual separators.
- Strengthened pattern evaluation with guarded try/catch ensuring invalid regex patterns produce a controlled `Invalid pattern` error without aborting validation.
- Increased test granularity ensuring each atomic constraint is independently verifiable.
