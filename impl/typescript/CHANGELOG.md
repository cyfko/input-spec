## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### üéØ Major Changes

#### API Design Improvements
- **BREAKING:** Moved `required` field from constraints to top-level `InputFieldSpec`
- **BREAKING:** Changed constraints from `Record<string, ConstraintDescriptor>` to `ConstraintDescriptor[]`
- **NEW:** Added explicit `name` property to all constraints for better identification

#### Framework Integration
- **NEW:** Added `HttpClientFactory` for seamless framework integration
- **NEW:** Angular HttpClient adapter preserving interceptors and DI
- **NEW:** Axios adapter supporting custom configurations

### üîÑ Migration from v1.x

#### Breaking Changes
1. **Required Field Location**
   ```typescript
   // v1.x
   const oldSpec = {
     constraints: {
       validation: { required: true, pattern: "..." }
     }
   };
   
   // v2.0
   const newSpec = {
     required: true,  // Moved to top-level
     constraints: [
       { name: 'validation', pattern: "..." }
     ]
   };
   ```

2. **Constraints Structure**
   ```typescript
   // v1.x - Record (unpredictable order)
   constraints: {
     'email': { pattern: '...' },
     'length': { min: 5, max: 50 }
   }
   
   // v2.0 - Array (predictable order)
   constraints: [
     { name: 'email', pattern: '...' },
     { name: 'length', min: 5, max: 50 }
   ]
   ```

#### Migration Tools
- Automated migration script: `npm run migrate:v2`
- Step-by-step migration guide with examples
- Validation tools to ensure successful migration

### üì¶ Package Changes

- Dual package exports (ESM/CJS)
- Tree-shaking friendly exports
- Improved module resolution

#### Dependencies
